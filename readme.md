# 108

*108 is a minimal beat machine featuring 5 classic samples that can be arranged on a 16 step loop running 108 bpm.*

The app is built using some really great libraries:

- [Snap.svg](https://github.com/adobe-webplatform/Snap.svg)
- [GreenSock Animation Platform](https://github.com/greensock/GreenSock-JS)
